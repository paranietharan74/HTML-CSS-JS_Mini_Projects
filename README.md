## 01. Countdown Timer
My project is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary function is to display a reverse countdown timer that calculates and shows the number of days left until the upcoming New Year's celebration. Users can visit the website to instantly see how much time remains before the next New Year's Eve. The countdown adds an element of excitement and anticipation to the occasion, making it a fun and engaging way to keep track of this annual event.
